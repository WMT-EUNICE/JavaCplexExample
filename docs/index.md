## Java and CPLEX example project: Precendence Constrained Knapsack Problem

This is a project page for a small example project that showcases how to use CPLEX from Java. It solves the Precedence Constrained Knapsack Problem, but is a useful example if you intend to implement other optimization problems that involve (directed) graphs.
